# GitFitCode Pair Coding Challenge

## Most Common Word

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.  It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.
Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.  Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.

## Project Notes

*Input:*

- paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
- banned = ["hit"]
*Output:* "ball"

- write one or more methods that returns the most common words
- 1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000.
- 0 <= banned.length <= 100.
- 1 <= banned[i].length <= 10.
- The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
- paragraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?',;.
- There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
- Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.

### Tips

- Spend some time reading documentation together! [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp)
- Make sure that y'all really breakdown these problems into manageable parts that you can solve. It is a lot easier to solve a bunch of tiny problems vs a large one.
- Make sure to use proper styling and to comment your code! Please tab 2, can be set by default!
- Before solving any problem, really breakdown all the rules. Maybe even play a couple games so you can easily describe it.
- Feel free to contact @GitFitDev or @Sirrele for assistance! I hope y'all have fun doing this together!
- You all will kill it! Ready? Set? GIT FIT COOOOOOOOODE!
